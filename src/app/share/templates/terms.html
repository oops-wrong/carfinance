            <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Your information shared</strong></span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">Information about our customers is an important part of our business and we take appropriate measure to ensure that this is kept secure. By making an application through our website and submitting your personal details this will, however, be taken as your consent for us process and to share your information in the following ways:</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Businesses we do not control</strong></span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">Our website features the products and services of third party providers. Where a service is to be provided by a third party, for example our motor loan, warranties, insurance, car data check and value of your car, your information will be shared with that third party for purposes of delivering that service to you. You will be able to tell when a third party is involved in your transactions and when your customer information is shared before you submit any information, you will be notified and then it is up to you whether or not you want to provide it. Where you purchase products or services or provide information or access another website through our website, use of any information collected is subject to the privacy policy of the operator of the site you’re visiting or the provider of such products or services. We are not responsible for the data protection practices of those other sites. This privacy policy applies solely to information collected on this website. We encourage our users to read the privacy policies of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. That privacy policy may differ from ours. If you cannot find the privacy policy and require more information, please contact the provider directly.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Sale of Business</strong></span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">If the business is sold or integrated with another business, your details may be disclosed to our advisers and any prospective purchasers and their advisers and will be passed on to the new owners of the business.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Credit Reference Agencies</strong></span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">When you make an application with us, our selected partners may carry out a search with credit reference agencies (Affinion, Equifax and/or Experian) for the purpose of assessing your credit score in connection with your application for finance. They will only do a soft search of your details which is not visible to other lenders so even if you are declined at this stage it won&#8217;t be reflected on your credit file. Credit reference agencies will provide a credit scoring computation and if, based on this score our partners can proceed with your application, they will pass your information onto a number of suitable lenders (two on average) who will carry out a hard search on your credit file.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">Credit reference agencies hold public and credit account information about you including details from the electoral register, country court judgments, bankruptcies, individual voluntary arrangements, administration orders and other data on how you are managing existing credit agreements. Carrying out hard searches will enable the lenders to calculate the level of risk of providing credit to each applicant based on the information obtained. Such searches will be recorded on your credit file leaving a footprint and this allows other lenders and organisations to see when and how many times your credit information has been accessed.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">To verify your identity, prevent crime and assist in the recovery of debt, we may exchange information from time to time with Fraud Prevention Agencies (including CIFAS), Debt Recovery Agencies, and other relevant organisations including other lenders.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Others</strong></span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #000000;">We may share your information where it is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, other users, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities. We also reserve the right to disclose user information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.</span></p>
